* Concurrency and async / await
    - If you are using third party libraries that tell you to call them with await like,
            results = await some_library()
        Then, declare your path operation functions with async def like:
            @app.get('/')
            async def read_results():
                results = await some_library()
                return results
    
    - You can only use await inside of functions created with async def.
    - use async def if the application need to communicate with anything else of wait for it to response.
    - If you just don't know, use normal def.
